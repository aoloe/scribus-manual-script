#Porting the Scribus Calendar to the new Scripter

## The thew Scripter

- The Scripter itself is programmed in Python

- the scripts are .spy files (why?)

- Object oriented:
  document = Scripter.activeDocument
   
- Simply ebmedded in the menu structure and allows shortcuts to be defined.
  Just add in the "structured" comments at the beginning of the file
    \#\# shortcut = Esc,f
    \#\# menu = &File

- Scripts in .../bin/scribus/lib/scribus/plugins/scripter/autoload are loaded on start
  The few scripts in that directory are very helpful! for understanding 

- Much easier to extend with new commands

- New concept for the documentation

Open questions:
 - Why .spy files?

But, must be further improved:
- some small fixes in the editor (most of all the highlight color for the current line)
- it must be easier to run again the last script you have run
