# Notes

## Contributing to the scripter documentation
there is an official documentation that is edited with a revision system in structured file by a few people. and a commenting system that allows everybody to easily put their comments there where they think other people will need them...
and, in a second step, the editors will go through the comments and integrate them into the "official" docs
